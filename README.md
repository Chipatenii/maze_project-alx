The goal of this Maze Game Project is to create a 3D game using the raycasting technique. Raycasting is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to simulate a 3D environment in a 2D space. I have always been fascinated and curious as to how games are made and how they are developed. Once this opportunity presented itself to develop a maze game using SDL2, C++ and the raycasting technique, I invested maximum time ensuring that I get a good grasp of what I needed to do to make this a reality. This project is to be implemented on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using the gcc compiler and the SDL2 and SDL2_image library for graphics and input.
